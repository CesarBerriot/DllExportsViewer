Step 1 : 
Download NSIS (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)

Step 2 :
Compile the program (This is basic CMake knowledge, just google how it's done).

Step 3 :
Copy the following from your build folder into the bin folder :
- plugins/
- DllExportsViewer.exe
- libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- libwinpthread-1.dll
- Qt6Core.dll
- Qt6Gui.dll
- Qt6Widgets.dll

Step 3.5 (Optional) :
Run bin/DllExportsViewer.exe and make sure you don't get any missing dll errors (which most likely means you forgot something).

Step 4 :
Right click DllExportsViewer.nsi and select "Compile NSIS Script"
